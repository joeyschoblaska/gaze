# Gaze
Track which applications and domains you're focusing on and print them to the terminal.

## Usage
```
bundle
ruby gaze.rb
```

Example output:
```
Recent apps and websites:
 -   [55s]: iTerm2
 -   [30s]: Music
 -   [12s]: github.com
```

## But why?
I sometimes overlay the output from this script on my webcam when I'm doing a [Focus Mates](https://focusmates.com) session for added accountability.
