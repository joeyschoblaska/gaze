# Gaze
Track which applications and domains you're focusing on and print them to the terminal.

## Usage
```
bundle
ruby gaze.rb
```

Example output:
```
Recent apps and websites:
 -   [55s]: iTerm2
 -   [30s]: Music
 -   [12s]: github.com
```

## But why?
I sometimes overlay the output from this script on my webcam when I'm doing a [Focusmate](https://focusmate.com) session for added accountability. It scales a lot better than [hiring someone to slap me](https://web.archive.org/web/20220312054133/https://hackthesystem.com/blog/why-i-hired-a-girl-on-craigslist-to-slap-me-in-the-face-and-why-it-quadrupled-my-productivity/).
